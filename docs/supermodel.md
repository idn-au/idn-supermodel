## Introduction

This "Supermodel" is a multi-part model that is used to coordinate expressions of data from multiple systems within the Geological Survey of Queensland (GSQ). Specifically, this model allows for:

* integration of data across systems
* for multi-system data holding analytics
* for system rationalisation planning
* delivery of coordinated data
* taking data from multiple, internal, data sources and delivering it for public or analytics use, in a coordinated manner

The major parts of this Supermodel are shown in [Figure 0](#the-supermodel) above.

Only a few of the total Vocabularies and Component Models of this Supermodel have so far been defined: see the status in [Overview/Status](index.md#status).

### Related Supermodels

This Supermodel relates to several other Supermodels in existence. The table below gives some details.

Supermodel | Relationship
--- | ---
[Foundational Spatial Data Framework Supermodel](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/fsdf-supermodel) | The FSDF Supermodel was created by [Geoscience Australia](https://www.ga.gov.au) to integrate multiple foundational spatial datasets within Australia. It specifies both a structure for spatial data and particular fundamental objects to join datasets with, such as authoritative boundaries for Australia and the states.<br /><br />This supermodel adopts the FSDF Supermodel ways of working for spatial data
[Geological Survey of Western Australia's Supermodel](http://nicholascar.com/gswa-supermodel/) | A Supermodel for a similar agency to GSQ's. It implements many of the same Background Models, Vocabularies and some of the same Component Models, such as [Boreholes](components.md#boreholes-profile)

## Supermodel Structure

The structure of this Supermodel follows the conventions of the _Supermodel Model_ defined at:

* <https://linked.data.gov.au/def/supermodel>

Each of the main parts of this Supermodel is listed on the left.

Individual data models - called _Component Models_ here - are given within the [Component Models Section](components.md).

## Modelling Conventions

All of the models within this Supermodel are visualised with informal OWL diagrams. These are diagrams that represent the Classes, Properties and Axioms of the [Web Ontology Language](background.md#web-ontology-language-owl) with the elements shown in Figure K below.

## Technical Assets

Many parts of this Supermodel, for example individual Component Models, are presented here in human-readable form (documentation) and also presented in machine-readable form for data validation and schema implementation. 

Machine-readable assets are presented as _Resources_ per model. For example, the schema for the [Boreholes Profile](components/boreholes-profile.md) model is given in the [Boreholes Profile Schema](components/boreholes-profile.md#schema) section and its validators in the [Boreholes Profile Validators](components/boreholes-profile.md#validators) section.
