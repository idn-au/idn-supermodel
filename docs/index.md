## Status

### February 2023

This Supermodel is intended to become the overarching . integrative data model for the GSQ's public data but, as of early 2023, it is in an early stage of development with few / no Component Models completed. By min-2023, it is expected that several C 
Component Models, such as Boreholes, Samples etc. will be complete enough for initial public delivery.

Currently, as of February 2023, the following elements have been established:

* [Vocabularies](vocabularies.md)
* some aspects of the [Backbone Model](backbone.md), and the 
* [Component Models](components.md)
    * [Boreholes Profile](components/boreholes-profile.md) - developed
    * [Samples Profile](components/samples-profile.md) - started
