## About

This is a documentation website for a Supermodel: a multi-part Knowledge Graph data model.

This particular Supermodel is for information related to indigenous data managed by the [Indigenous Data Network](https://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/centres-institutes/centre-for-health-equity/research-group/indigenous-data-network) within the [Indigenous Studies Unit](https://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/centres-institutes/centre-for-health-equity/research-group/indigenous-studies) of the University of Melbourne.

This Supermodel both provides an integration framework for the IDN's own data and also a coordinated set of reference datasets for other organisations to use in characterising indigenous information.
