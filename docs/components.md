# Component Models

This section lists the various Component Models within this Supermodel.

## Profiles

Many of the Component Models here are defined as a _profile_, by which we mean that it is a model that draws from other Standard's models and constrains and extends their elements, rather than creating its own elements.

Profiles are used to specialise general-purpose models while remaining conformant with them.
 
Formally, any data created according to a _profile_ _MUST_ conform to all the models it profiles, as per the [Profiles Vocabulary](background.md#profiles-vocabulary-prof) rules.

Profiles may profile multiple Standards, bringing together all the parts needed for a particular task
