=== ISO19115-1 Role Codes

This vocabulary is a well known and widely used codelist of the roles that `Agent`s play in relation to `Dataset`s. The codelist was originally presented in the first version of ISO19115 (2003) as a table in a PDF document and has been delivered online in multiple forms but always unofficially: the ISO has not yet published an authoratitive form.

A current ISO test publication of this codelist as a SKOS vocabulary is online at http://115.146.86.155/vocab/CI_RoleCode, taken from the 2018 form of ISO19115-1. 

The roles and their descriptions from this codelist are given in the table below for quick reference.

=== Indigenous Data Governance Roles

#TODO: Establish this vocab in RVA#

This vocabulary is core to the description of indigenous governance of IDN data. It specifies a series of indigenous roles that are partly derived from the roles in the <<ISO19115-1 Role Codes, Role Codes>> vocabulary above but uses definitions established by the IDN.

NOTE: This vocabulary is in development within the IDN so, until this message is removed, this is not a complete or final vocabulary.
